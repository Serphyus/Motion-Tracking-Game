    """A static image or an animation to render in pygame.

    Creates a staic or animated surface object. The surface requires at least
    1 frame to be initialized and if given 1 frame it will default it's state 
    to a non-animated surface. The animated property can be changed at any given
    time true or false. If true the surface will engage in an internal counter
    which will update the current frame based on the speed parameter. If the
    animated property is false the counter will never change and the `get`
    method will only return the first frame.
    
    Exceptions:
        - `ValueError` will be raised the frames parameter contains no elements.

        - `animated` (bool): a boolean to decide whether image is static or to be animated.
        - `speed` (int): a integer to determine the speed of the animation.
        - `looped` (bool): a boolean to make animation continuous.
